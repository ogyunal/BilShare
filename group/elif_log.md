On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 02.05.2020 ~
I worked on designing UI using the Vaadin framework and we created a UI for the profile page with Yağmur. 

### ~ 04.05.2020 ~

I made research about connecting a java program to a database and storing information on a cloud rather than a local repository.

#### ~ 11.05.2020 ~

We designed UI of the "Contact us" and "About" pages with Yağmur. In addition, we made configurations on My Profile Page so that users can see and edit their own adverts. In order to provide this, we added methods to Product repository which filter the products according to the username and change the properties of a product by using update query. However, we used an example username 'user' since we didn't manage to obtain the current user's info yet.
