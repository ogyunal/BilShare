On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 02.05.2020 ~
I worked on designing UI using the Vaadin framework and we created a UI for the profile page with Yağmur. 

### ~ 04.05.2020 ~
I made research about connecting a java program to a database and storing information on a cloud rather than a local repository.

#### ~ 12.05.2020 ~
We designed UI of the "Contact us" and "About" pages with Yağmur.
