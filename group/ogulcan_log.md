On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

Started to learn and work on how html&css is displayed on the frontend, created the base maven project that runs within tomcat server that has the template start for our project.

### ~ 28.04.2020 ~
This week i worked on data services and figured out how cloud databases work with mysql. Learned how CRUD operations take place using JPA Repository-Entity-Service Pattern.

### ~ 01.05.2020 ~
As a group, we all handled the version control system within our IDE's and started working on signup&login page. Learned more about the AWS Systems such as Elastic Beanstalk and Relational Database Services.

### ~ 05.05.2020 ~
Reordered the Components such as Navbar, Header and Drawer as our app's needs. Designed the sign up page as a dialog pop up and created the form to let users sign up (handled by mysql).

Overall security, authentication, session management, output validation failures e.g. database record set mismatch, invalid data encoding (for image storage on adverts) and application related system improvements.

UX and UI Improvements, deployed the production version to AWS Systems on a cloud database, also configured Route53 to handle DNS and NS forwards to get the domain "www.bil-share.com" to work.

### ~ 19.05.2020 ~
Demonstration of the app was done and uploaded to youtube, core functionality is perfectly working, tiny updates are needed, also there is a bug caused by vaadin that restricts the user by signing up twice, submitted the problem to stack overflow and couple forums, hoping we get an answer...
