On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### 13.04.2020
This week we created our Github repository.

### 20.04.2020
This week I worked on the GUI of the main page panel, created book and lecture note classes.

### 27.04.2020
As a group we decided to create a web app instead of a desktop app so we started to use Vaddin framework and watched a youtube series to learn about this frame work. I tried to write Book service and Lecture note service classes according to the videos but it did not work.Besides I integrated Git to the InteliJ.

### 04.05.2020
We worked on the GUI of profile view by using Vaadin with my friend Elif. Besides, we are all trying to find out how to integrate a database in our app. We decided to use mysql as the database. I downloaded mysql workbench to my computer to reach the tables.We had some diffuculties while trying to save product data to database and did some research about Jpa annotations. I also worked on DataService class as there were some errors. 

### 11.05.2020
We created the ui of "Contact Us" and "About" pages with my friend Elif. Besides, we added a product form in profile page where user can change the properties of his/her advert. We added methods by using query codes to update the database according to user's changes and configured the ProductRepsitory hence ProductService classes.
