As the group g3J, We have learned how to create a web app from scratch using various frameworks such as Vaadin,Spring Boot and Spring. In addition, for our database, we have learned how to use Java Persistence API (JPA) which is an interface specification that describes the management of relational data in applications, Hibernate which is a mapping tool that enables us to interact with the database and MySQL. Also, we have learned how to use Maven which is a project management and comprehension tool. We collaborated with our teammates using Github Version Control and reached the code easily which was a useful learning experience. The most difficult aspect of the project was binding the MySQL database to our project and performing the CRUD operations to manipulate our data. If we were to do the project again we would consider binding the database to our project from the beginning rather than dealing with it at the end. We spent a lot of time- about 2 months in order to get things working, since we were at our homes trying to meetup virtually. We are proud of what we have achieved as we managed to get a solid webapp working.
