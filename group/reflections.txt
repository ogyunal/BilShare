As the group g3J, we have learned how to create a web app from scratch using various frameworks such as Vaadin and Spring Boot. In addition, for our database, we have learned how to use Java Persistence API (JPA), Hibernate and MySQL. Also, we. 
have learned how to use Maven. We collaborated with our teammates using Github Version Control which proved to be very useful 
for every team member to reach the up-to-date code easily. The most difficult aspect of the project was binding the MySQL 
database to our project and performing the CRUD operations to manipulate our data. If we were to do the project again we would 
consider binding the database to our project from the beginning rather than dealing with it at the end. We spent a lot of 
time- about 2 months in order to get things working, since we were at our homes trying to meetup virtually. We are proud of
what we have achieved as we managed to get a solid webapp working.
