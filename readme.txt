## Project Description
Buying and selling second-hand books and lecture notes is one of the most common transactions among university students as some of the firsthand books are very expensive or cannot be found in the bookstores. Besides, some students prefer to buy the lecture notes rather than take notes and others prefer to take notes and sell them. However, the process of meeting the customer with a reliable seller is frustrating and hard. Up to this day, some social media platforms are used for this aim like the Bilkent Duyuru which is created by the students. However, the problem about these platforms is that the content and adverts within these platforms is quite messy and students have difficulties to find a relevant advert. Therefore, we propose a platform that can be used only for buying and selling second-hand books and lecture notes. In this way, students can easily negotiate about the deals and a win- win condition can be provided for the seller and the buyer. Buyers will be able to filtrate through the adverts and easily find the relevant advert from a reliable seller while, on the other hand, the sellers will be able to reach the customer much more effectively. The platform is mainly for Bilkent students. However, in the future, the scope can be extended to teachers or assistants.

   
## Project Status
So far, we were able to create the basic UI components for all our views, connect our product list to a MySQL Database. However, we are not able to create new users and add them to our database yet. The only way to enter to the web app is by using "user" as username and "password" as password. We will be working on connecting our users to databases. After we successfully connect our database to the users we will be able to take data from our database and use them in the MyProfile view.
